Steps to Make It


 

    Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease and flour 2 (8-inch) round cake pans or coat with baking spray and set aside. 


    In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. 


    Add the applesauce, almond milk, oil, and vanilla. Stir to combine.
 

    Fold in the carrots and walnuts, if using. Do not overmix.
   

    Pour the cake batter evenly between the prepared pans, then bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean and the tops of the cakes are set.


    Remove from the oven, and cool in the pans on a wire rack for about 20 minutes before carefully removing from the pans. Allow the cakes to cool completely on the wire rack before frosting.

    For the frosting, whip the vegan butter, vegan cream cheese, and vanilla extract until combined.
 

    Gradually add the confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy.

    Frost between the layers, over the top and down the sides of the cake.


    Garnish with additional chopped walnuts, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
